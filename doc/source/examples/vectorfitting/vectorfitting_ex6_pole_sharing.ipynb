    "# Ex5: Pole sharing\n",
    "In vanilla vector fitting, all responses share a common set of poles. In the literature, this case is called MIMO fitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are applications in which this can lead to problems and it is desirable to use a separate pole set for each response. In the literature, this is called Multi-SISO fitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also possible to go anywhere between those two extreme cases, for example by using a common set of poles for every input j, for example: S1j, S2j, S3j, ... will share one set of poles for every value of the input j. We thus have one pole set per input, which is used for the transfer of this input j to all outputs j=1, 2, 3, ... This is why in the literature this approach is called Multi-SIMO fitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, arbitrary combinations of inputs and outputs can be grouped to use a separate set of poles per group.\n",
    "\n",
    "In vectorFitting, MIMO, Multi-SISO, Multi-SIMO, Multi-MISO and arbitrary custom pole groups are supported.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example shows how those can be used."
