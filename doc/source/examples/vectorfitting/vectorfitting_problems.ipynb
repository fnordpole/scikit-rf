    "From points 1) and 2) it is obvious that the number of poles has to be chosen carefully, which often requires several attempts to get right. But even with the right number of poles, the fit quality and the required number of iterations can be disappointing in case of strong noise in the data, usually from measurements. In such cases, successful vector fits might still be achieved with `auto_fit()`, an improved and automated version of the vector fitting algorithm utilizing iterative pole adding and skimming.\n",

The unsued poles get shifted toward higher frequencies outside the measured band and still spook around during the relocation process.

Interstingly, the residue settles rather quickly within the first 20 iterations, as shown in the convergence plot.\n",

    "During the pole relocation process (first step in the fitting process), the starting poles are sucessively moved to frequencies where they can best match all target responses. Additionally, the type of poles can change from real to complex-conjugate: two real poles can become one complex-conjugate pole (and vise versa). As a result, there are multiple combinations of starting poles which can produce the same final set of poles. However, certain setups will converge faster than others, which also depends on the initial pole spacing. In extreme cases, the algorithm can even be \"undecided\" if two real poles behave exactly like one complex-conjugate pole and it gets \"stuck\" jumping back and forth without converging to a final solution."
