    "# Ex5: Weighting\n",
    "This example demonstrates how weighting can be used to balance the fit accuracy between large and small magnitudes of the response.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the vector fitting algorithm uses a least squares fit, large values in the responses contribute more to the least squares error than small values, thus giving them by default more weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "But sometimes we are interested to accurately fit very small magnitudes of a response very accurately, for example when analyzing the cross-talk or isolation between certain ports of a network.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we can weight every sample by multiplying it with its inverse magnitude in the least squares fit and so we will get the same relative accuracy for large and small values. "

This is normal and comes because we gave more weight to the small values. The least squares fit will sacrifice a bit of the accuracy in the large magnitudes in favor of the accuracy in the small magnitudes. \n",

This parameter limits the magnitude weighting to a certain level, for example -40 dB. Every magnitude below this level is not weighted by more than the limit. \n",

    "Moreover, the weights can directly be providid as an argument and thus, arbitrary user defined weights can be used. Details on this can be found in the documentation of the arguments of auto_fit()."
